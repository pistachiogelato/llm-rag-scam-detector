ham,thats cool. i am a gentleman and will treat you with dignity and respect.
ham,"the last thing i ever wanted to do was hurt you. and i didn't think it would have. you'd laugh, be embarassed, delete the tag and keep going. but as far as i knew, it wasn't even up. the fact that you even felt like i would do it to hurt you shows you really don't know me at all. it was messy wednesday, but it wasn't bad. the problem i have with it is you have the time to clean it, but you choose not to. you skype, you take pictures, you sleep, you want to go out. i don't mind a few things here and there, but when you don't make the bed, when you throw laundry on top of it, when i can't have a friend in the house because i'm embarassed that there's underwear and bras strewn on the bed, pillows on the floor, that's something else. you used to be good about at least making the bed."
